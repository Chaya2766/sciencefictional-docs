    <li><a href="encapsulated_rydberg_matter_for_energy_storage.pdf">Encapsulated rydberg matter for energy storage</a><br>Hard sci-fi concept of an energy storage material 1 order of magnitude in specific energy above chemical fuels (0.5GJ/kg). My take, together with supporting calculations, on the use of rydberg matter for energy storage, as excited hydrogen compressed & trapped inside capped carbon nanotubes.<br>note: the validity of the concept of rydberg matter itself appears to be controversial</li>
    <li><a href="asteroid_mining_outpost.pdf">Asteroid mining outpost: Rate of extraction of materials from asteroids</a><br>I take note of the lack of scientific papers that look into <i>how quickly</i> we could mine an asteroid, and examine the open-pit mines of modern earth to get an estimate in my own semi-scientific style, and present a relation between the surface area being mined out and the rate at which material is extracted, which allows calculating the rate of production of the asteroid mine in kg/h for a number of elements.<br>This analysis notably makes no statement about the actual amount of equipment needed for running the mining operation, but as a matter of being calculated from data about real mines likely provides extraction rates that are in line with what would be expected given the other limiting factors such as being able to refine the gathered material quickly enough.</li>
    <li><a href="third_millenium_exponential_growth.pdf">humanity of the third millenium under assumption of exponential growth</a><br>There are many methods for modeling the growth of humanity, many conflicting and some producing unusual conclusions such as infinities at certain points in time - here I take the simplest approach and match the relevant data between the years 1900 and 2021/2023 to an exponential curve in these areas:<br><br>total population, life expectancy, GDP (global total \& per capita), energy consumption (global total \& per capita).<br><br>Results are presented as plots showing the curve and the real data together, as well as plots \& tables showing resulting values for the future between years 2000 and 3000.</li>
    <li><a href="encapsulated_metalic_hydrogen.pdf">Diamond-encapsulated metalic hydrogen for energy storage</a><br>Here I present a hypothetical means of energy storage by encapsulating metalic hydrogen inside diamond spheres. The resulting material has specific energy of 666kJ/kg, which is 2 orders of magnitude below the specific energies of common chemical fuels such as coal or ethanol. As an extra case based on my previous paper, the metalic hydrogen is turned into rydberg matter which yields a specific energy of 4MJ/kg, 2.5 to 5 times lower than that of coal.<br><br>In conclusion encapsulating metalic hydrogen in diamond doesn't appear to be a viable means of energy storage. No method of manufacturing such diamond capsules of metalic hydrogen is discussed.</li>
