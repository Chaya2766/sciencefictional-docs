    <li><a href="encapsulated_rydberg_matter_for_energy_storage.pdf">Encapsulated rydberg matter for energy storage</a><br>Hard sci-fi concept of an energy storage material 1 order of magnitude in specific energy above chemical fuels (0.5GJ/kg). My take, together with supporting calculations, on the use of rydberg matter for energy storage, as excited hydrogen compressed & trapped inside capped carbon nanotubes.<br>note: the validity of the concept of rydberg matter itself appears to be controversial</li>
    <li><a href="asteroid_mining_outpost.pdf">Asteroid mining outpost: Rate of extraction of materials from asteroids</a><br>I take note of the lack of scientific papers that look into <i>how quickly</i> we could mine an asteroid, and examine the open-pit mines of modern earth to get an estimate in my own semi-scientific style, and present a relation between the surface area being mined out and the rate at which material is extracted, which allows calculating the rate of production of the asteroid mine in kg/h for a number of elements.<br>This analysis notably makes no statement about the actual amount of equipment needed for running the mining operation, but as a matter of being calculated from data about real mines likely provides extraction rates that are in line with what would be expected given the other limiting factors such as being able to refine the gathered material quickly enough.</li>
